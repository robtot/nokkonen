# Nokkonen Recipe Sharing Website

This is a project started by Robert Rytovuori in late 2015.

The project's end goal is to be a website where users can store recipes as well as generate grocery lists based on ingredients in recipes. It also attempts to modularize recipes so that parts can be included in other recipes. For example, a recipe for a sauce can be included in another recipe.
